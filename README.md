uutils coreutils
================

uutils is an attempt at writing universal (as in cross-platform) CLI
utils in [Rust](http://rust-lang.org). This repo is to aggregate the GNU
coreutils rewrites.

Why?
----

Many GNU, linux and other utils are pretty awesome, and obviously
[some](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net) [effort](http://unxutils.sourceforge.net)
has been spent in the past to port them to windows. However those projects
are either old, abandonned, hosted on CVS, written in platform-specific C, etc.

Rust provides a good platform-agnostic way of writing systems utils that are easy
to compile anywhere, and this is as good a way as any to try and learn it.

Contribute
----------

Contributions are very welcome.  You may *claim* an item on the to-do list by following these steps:

1. Open an issue named "Implement [the utility of your choice]", e.g. "Implement ls"
2. State that you are working on this utility.
3. Develop the utility.
4. Submit a pull request and close the issue.  Your pull request should include deleting the utility from the to-do list on this README.

The steps above imply that, before starting to work on a utility, you should search the issues to make sure no one else is working on it.

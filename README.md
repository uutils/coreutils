uutils is an attempt at writing universal (as in cross-platform) CLI
utils in [Rust](http://www.rust-lang.org). This repo is to aggregate the GNU
coreutils rewrites.

Why?
----

Many GNU, Linux and other utils are pretty awesome, and obviously
[some](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net) [effort](http://unxutils.sourceforge.net)
has been spent in the past to port them to Windows. However, those projects
are either old, abandoned, hosted on CVS, written in platform-specific C, etc.

Rust provides a good, platform-agnostic way of writing systems utils that are easy
to compile anywhere, and this is as good a way as any to try and learn it.

Build Instructions
------------------

To simply build all available utilities:
```
make
```

(on Windows use [MinGW/MSYS](http://www.mingw.org/wiki/MSYS) or `Cygwin` make and make sure you have `rustc` in `PATH`)

To build all but a few of the available utilities:
```
make SKIP_UTILS='UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2'
```

To build only a few of the available utilities:
```
make UTILS='UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2'
```

Installation Instructions
-------------------------

To install all available utilities:
```
make install
```

To install all but a few of the available utilities:
```
make SKIP_UTILS='UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2' install
```

To install only a few of the available utilities:
```
make UTILS='UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2' install
```

To install every program with a prefix (e.g. uu-echo uu-cat):
```
make PROG_PREFIX=PREFIX_GOES_HERE install
```

To install the multicall binary:
```
make MULTICALL=y install
```

Set install parent directory (default value is /usr/local):
```
make PREFIX=/my/path install
```

Uninstallation Instructions
---------------------------

To uninstall all utilities:
```
make uninstall
```

To uninstall every program with a set prefix:
```
make PROG_PREFIX=PREFIX_GOES_HERE uninstall
```

To uninstall the multicall binary:
```
make MULTICALL=y uninstall
```

To uninstall from a custom parent directory:
```
make PREFIX=/my/path uninstall
```

Test Instructions
-----------------

To simply test all available utilities:
```
make test
```

To test all but a few of the available utilities:
```
make SKIP_UTILS='UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2' test
```

To test only a few of the available utilities:
```
make UTILS='UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2' test
```

To include tests for unimplemented behavior:
```
make UTILS='UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2' SPEC=y test
```

Run busybox tests
-----------------

This testing functionality is only available on *nix operating systems

To run busybox's tests for all utilities for which busybox has tests
```
make busytest
```

To run busybox's tests for a few of the available utilities
```
make UTILS='UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2' busytest
```

To pass an argument like "-v" to the busybox test runtime
```
make UTILS='UTILITY_1 UTILITY_2' RUNTEST_ARGS='-v' busytest
```

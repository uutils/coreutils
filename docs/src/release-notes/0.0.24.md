**Version:** 0.0.24
**Published:** 2024-01-25T22:49:24Z

## Release Notes

ðŸ“¦ **Rust Coreutils 0.0.24 Release:**

We've got +29 more GNU tests passing than in our last release! We are getting closer to version 1.0: each test passed is a step forward in ensuring that our users have a reliable and robust set of utilities that align closely with GNU standards.

49 developers contributed to this release (28 new contributors started with this release).

A key highlight of this release is the expansion of support to new platforms and operating systems. Notably, the software has been ported to sparc64, OpenBSD, and Redox, broadening its usability across different system architectures and environments. This marks a significant step in making Rust Coreutils more versatile and accessible to a wider range of users and developers.

In addition to these expansions, the release has also focused on the integration of more fuzzing techniques, including differential fuzzing and OSS Fuzz integration.

We also contributed to the GNU implementation to improve their test coverage.

We would like to thank to the support the Sovereign Tech Fund for their support (more details later).

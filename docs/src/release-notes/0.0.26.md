## Release Notes

ðŸ“¦ **Rust Coreutils 0.0.26 Release:**

We are happy to announce the release of Rust Coreutils 0.0.26! This version comes with several significant advancements, including the initial support for AIX, ensuring broader compatibility and reach.

This update adds +10 GNU passing tests compared to version 0.0.25.

### New in this Release:
- **Beginning of the AIX Support**
- **Updated GNU Reference:** We've updated our testsuite to GNU Coreutils 9.5.
- **Improved Compatibility:** Thanks to the community's efforts, we've addressed several compatibility issues, pushing our pass rate even higher.

This release saw contributions from 20 developers, including 12 newcomers.

### **Rust Coreutils 0.6.0 Release:**

We are happy to announce the release of **Rust Coreutils 0.6.0** — a major milestone achieving **96% GNU compatibility** with significant safety improvements, enhanced locale support, and extensive bug fixes!

---

### Highlights:

- **Major GNU Compatibility Leap**
  - **622 passing tests** (+56 from 0.5.0), achieving **96.28%** compatibility
  - Reduced failures from 55 to just 16 (-39) and skipped tests from 23 to 7 (-16)
  - Extensive test suite improvements across `sort`, `ls`, `date`, `cksum`, `tail`, and many more

- **Safety & Code Quality**
  - Removed unsafe code from `date`, `sort`, `locale.rs`, and other utilities
  - Replaced raw `libc` calls with safe `nix` crate equivalents throughout
  - Enhanced error handling to avoid panics on `/dev/full` writes across many utilities

- **Locale & Internationalization**
  - Added ICU support for locale-aware day/month names in `date`
  - Implemented locale-aware hour formatting and calendar support
  - Added locale-aware numeric sorting with thousand separator support in `sort`
  - Locale-aware collation support in `join`

- **Performance Improvements**
  - `base32`/`base64`/`basenc`: Optimized with reduced memset operations
  - `shuf`: Optimized numeric output and added `--random-seed` option
  - `date`: Wrapped stdout in BufWriter for batch processing
  - `uniq`: Optimized memory usage for ignore-case comparison
  - `tsort`: Avoid reading entire input into memory, intern strings
  - `df`: Performance improvements with better filesystem handling

- **Platform Support Expansion**
  - Expanded safe directory traversal to all Unix platforms
  - Enhanced Cygwin support across multiple utilities
  - Added SMACK security module support for `ls`, `id`, `mkdir`, `mkfifo`, `mknod`
  - Added RISC-V 64-bit musl target to CI

- **Notable Utility Improvements**
  - `cksum`/`hashsum`: Merged common logic, removed deprecated `hashsum` binary
  - `tail`: Added `--debug` flag, fixed `-F` symlink tracking, fixed `--pid` with FIFO
  - `timeout`: Added comprehensive signal handling and `--verbose` improvements
  - `sort`: Legacy `+POS/-POS` handling, locale-aware collation, debug key annotations
  - `pr`: Multiple fixes for headers, form feeds, and pagination options
  - `chmod`: Fixed recursive handling and `--preserve-root` option
  - `rm`: Fixed error reporting and symlink handling

- **Contributions**: This release was made possible by **41 new contributors** joining our community

# 0.2.0

**Version:** 0.2.0
**Published:** 2025-09-06T21:54:03Z

## Release Notes

### üì¶ **Rust Coreutils 0.2.0 Release:**

We are excited to announce the release of **Rust Coreutils 0.2.0** ‚Äî our **first fully internationalized release**!
This milestone brings **comprehensive localization support**, **major performance improvements**, and **enhanced Unicode handling**.

---

### Highlights:

- **Full Internationalization & Localization**
  Complete translation infrastructure using Mozilla's Fluent framework with French translations included.
  Support for complex plural forms (Arabic, Hebrew, etc.) and locale-aware formatting.
  Even error messages from clap are fully localizable!

- **Community Translation Platform**
  Join our translation efforts at [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/rust-coreutils/)
  or contribute directly via our [l10n repository](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils-l10n)

- **Unicode & Non-UTF8 Path Support**
  All programs now handle non-UTF8 paths seamlessly while supporting full Unicode features.
  Example: `echo "üçîüçüü•§" | cut -d"üçü" -f1` works perfectly with emoji delimiters!

- **Massive Performance Gains**
  Notable example: `tr` went from **9.81x slower** than GNU to **1.58x faster** ‚Äî a 15x improvement!
  Additional optimizations in sort, cat, and other utilities.

- **Enhanced GNU Compatibility**
  **538 passing tests** (+16 from 0.1.0), with reduced failures from 65 to 52.
  Continued improvements in edge case handling and behavior matching.

- **Production Ready for Ubuntu**
  As part of Ubuntu's [announcement](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-devel/2025-September/043437.html) of plans to integrate Rust Coreutils, this release focuses on stability and compatibility improvements to ensure Ubuntu users have the best possible experience.

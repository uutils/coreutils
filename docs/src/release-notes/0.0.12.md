# 0.0.12

**Version:** 0.0.12
**Published:** 2022-01-19T14:53:45Z

## Release Notes

Due to problems with `stdbuf`, the previous release (0.0.9) required a patch to work and no binary artifacts were generated. This release fixes that issue.

## Changes
These are selected user-facing changes since 0.0.8.

* The minimum supported Rust version is now 1.54.
* The version numbers of the utils, the `coreutils` binary, `uucore` and `uucore_procs` are now synced. Hence the jump from 0.0.9 to 0.012.
* All utils now use `UResult` due to incredible work by @jfinkels, who contributed over 50 PRs for this to happen, with additional contributions by @thomasqueirozb, @Smicry and @E3uka. This change is mostly invisible to users, but does lead to more consistent error messages now and in the future.

# 🌍 Localization (L10n) in uutils coreutils

This guide explains how localization (L10n) is implemented in the **Rust-based coreutils project**, detailing the use of [Fluent](https://projectfluent.org/) files, runtime behavior, and developer integration.

---

## 📁 Fluent File Layout

Each utility has its own set of translation files under:

```
    src/uu/<utility>/locales/<locale>.ftl
```

Examples:

```
    src/uu/ls/locales/en-US.ftl
    src/uu/ls/locales/fr-FR.ftl
```

These files follow Fluent syntax and contain localized message patterns.

---

## ⚙️ Initialization

Localization must be explicitly initialized at runtime using:

```
    setup_localization(path)
```


This is typically done:
- In `src/bin/coreutils.rs` for **multi-call binaries**
- In `src/uucore/src/lib.rs` for **single-call utilities**

The string parameter determines the lookup path for Fluent files.

---

## 🌐 Locale Detection

Locale selection is automatic and performed via:

```
    fn detect_system_locale() -> Result<LanguageIdentifier, LocalizationError>
```

It reads the `LANG` environment variable (e.g., `fr-FR.UTF-8`), strips encoding, and parses the identifier.

If parsing fails or `LANG` is not set, it falls back to:

```
    const DEFAULT_LOCALE: &str = "en-US";
```

You can override locale at runtime by running:

```
    LANG=ja-JP ./target/debug/ls
```

---

## 📥 Retrieving Messages

Two APIs are available:

### `get_message(id: &str) -> String`

Returns the message from the current locale bundle.

```
    let msg = get_message("id-greeting");
```

If not found, falls back to `en-US`. If still missing, returns the ID itself.

---

### `get_message_with_args(id: &str, args: HashMap<String, String>) -> String`

Supports variable interpolation and pluralization.

```
    let msg = get_message_with_args(
        "error-io",
        HashMap::from([
            ("error".to_string(), std::io::Error::last_os_error().to_string())
        ])
    );
```

Fluent message example:

```
    error-io = I/O error occurred: { $error }
```

Variables must match the Fluent placeholder keys (`$error`, `$name`, `$count`, etc.).

---

## 📦 Fluent Syntax Example

```
    id-greeting = Hello, world!
    welcome = Welcome, { $name }!
    count-files = You have { $count ->
        [one] { $count } file
       *[other] { $count } files
    }
```

Use plural rules and inline variables to adapt messages dynamically.

---

## 🧪 Testing Localization

Run all localization-related unit tests with:

```
    cargo test --lib -p uucore
```

Tests include:
- Loading bundles
- Plural logic
- Locale fallback
- Fluent parse errors
- Thread-local behavior
- ...

---

## 🧵 Thread-local Storage

Localization is stored per thread using a `OnceLock`.
Each thread must call `setup_localization()` individually.
Initialization is **one-time-only** per thread — re-initialization results in an error.

---

## 🧪 Development vs Release Mode

During development (`cfg(debug_assertions)`), paths are resolved relative to the crate source:

```
    $CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR/../uu/<utility>/locales/
```

In release mode, **paths are resolved relative to the executable**:

```
    <executable_dir>/locales/<utility>/
```

If both fallback paths fail, an error is returned during `setup_localization()`.

---

## 🔤 Unicode Isolation Handling

By default, the Fluent system wraps variables with Unicode directional isolate characters (`U+2068`, `U+2069`) to protect against visual reordering issues in bidirectional text (e.g., mixing Arabic and English).

In this implementation, isolation is **disabled** via:

```
    bundle.set_use_isolating(false);
```

This improves readability in CLI environments by preventing extraneous characters around interpolated values:

Correct (as rendered):

```
    "Welcome, Alice!"
```

Fluent default (disabled here):

```
    "\u{2068}Alice\u{2069}"
```

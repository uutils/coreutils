# Platform support

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD033 -->

uutils aims to be as "universal" as possible, meaning that we try to support
many platforms. However, it is infeasible for us to guarantee that every
platform works. Just like Rust itself, we therefore have multiple tiers of
platform support, with different guarantees. We support two tiers of platforms:

 - **Tier 1**: All applicable utils are compiled and tested in CI for these
   platforms.
 - **Tier 2**: These platforms are supported but not actively tested. We do accept
   fixes for these platforms.

> **Note**: The tiers are dictated by our CI. We would happily accept a job
> in the CI for testing more platforms, bumping those platforms to tier 1.

## Platforms per tier

The platforms in tier 1 and the platforms that we test in CI are listed below.

| Operating system | Tested targets |
| ---------------- | -------------- |
| **Linux**        | `x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu` <br> `x86_64-unknown-linux-musl` <br> `arm-unknown-linux-gnueabihf` <br> `i686-unknown-linux-gnu` <br> `aarch64-unknown-linux-gnu` |
| **macOS**        | `x86_64-apple-darwin` |
| **Windows**      | `i686-pc-windows-msvc` <br> `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` <br> `x86_64-pc-windows-msvc` |
| **FreeBSD**      | `x86_64-unknown-freebsd` |
| **Android**      | `i686-linux-android` |

The platforms in tier 2 are more vague, but include:

 - untested variations of the platforms above,
 - Redox OS,
 - and BSDs such as OpenBSD, NetBSD & DragonFlyBSD.

## Utility compatibility per platform

Not all utils work on every platform. For instance, `chgrp` is not supported on
Windows, because Windows does have the concept of groups. Below is a full table
detailing which utilities are supported for the tier 1 platforms.

Note that for some utilities, not all functionality is supported on each
platform. This is documented per utility.

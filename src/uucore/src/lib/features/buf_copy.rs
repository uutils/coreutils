//! This module provides several buffer-based copy/write functions that leverage
//! the `splice` system call in Linux systems, thus increasing the I/O
//! performance of copying between two file descriptors. This module is mostly
//! used by utilities to work around the limitations of Rust's `fs::copy` which
//! does not handle copying special files (e.g pipes, character/block devices).

df-about = Show information about the file system on which each FILE resides,
  or all file systems by default.
df-usage = df [OPTION]... [FILE]...
df-after-help = Display values are in units of the first available SIZE from --block-size,
  and the DF_BLOCK_SIZE, BLOCK_SIZE and BLOCKSIZE environment variables.
  Otherwise, units default to 1024 bytes (or 512 if POSIXLY_CORRECT is set).

  SIZE is an integer and optional unit (example: 10M is 10*1024*1024).
  Units are K, M, G, T, P, E, Z, Y (powers of 1024) or KB, MB,... (powers
  of 1000).

# Help messages
df-help-print-help = Print help information.
df-help-all = include dummy file systems
df-help-block-size = scale sizes by SIZE before printing them; e.g. '-BM' prints sizes in units of 1,048,576 bytes
df-help-total = produce a grand total
df-help-human-readable = print sizes in human readable format (e.g., 1K 234M 2G)
df-help-si = likewise, but use powers of 1000 not 1024
df-help-inodes = list inode information instead of block usage
df-help-kilo = like --block-size=1K
df-help-local = limit listing to local file systems
df-help-no-sync = do not invoke sync before getting usage info (default)
df-help-output = use output format defined by FIELD_LIST, or print all fields if FIELD_LIST is omitted.
df-help-portability = use the POSIX output format
df-help-sync = invoke sync before getting usage info (non-windows only)
df-help-type = limit listing to file systems of type TYPE
df-help-print-type = print file system type
df-help-exclude-type = limit listing to file systems not of type TYPE

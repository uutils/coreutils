# comm

```
comm [OPTION]... FILE1 FILE2
```

Compare two sorted files line by line.

When FILE1 or FILE2 (not both) is -, read standard input.

With no options, produce three-column output. Column one contains
lines unique to FILE1, column two contains lines unique to FILE2,
and column three contains lines common to both files.

# head

```
head [FLAG]... [FILE]...
```

Print the first 10 lines of each `FILE` to standard output.
With more than one `FILE`, precede each with a header giving the file name.
With no `FILE`, or when `FILE` is `-`, read standard input.

Mandatory arguments to long flags are mandatory for short flags too.

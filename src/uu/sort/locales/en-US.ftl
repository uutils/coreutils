sort-about = Display sorted concatenation of all FILE(s). With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.
sort-usage = sort [OPTION]... [FILE]...
sort-after-help = The key format is FIELD[.CHAR][OPTIONS][,FIELD[.CHAR]][OPTIONS].

  Fields by default are separated by the first whitespace after a non-whitespace character. Use -t to specify a custom separator.
  In the default case, whitespace is appended at the beginning of each field. Custom separators however are not included in fields.

  FIELD and CHAR both start at 1 (i.e. they are 1-indexed). If there is no end specified after a comma, the end will be the end of the line.
  If CHAR is set 0, it means the end of the field. CHAR defaults to 1 for the start position and to 0 for the end position.

  Valid options are: MbdfhnRrV. They override the global options for this key.

//! Sort big files by using auxiliary files for storing intermediate chunks.

//! Files are read into chunks of memory which are then sorted individually and
//! written to temporary files. There are two threads: One sorter, and one reader/writer.
//! The buffers for the individual chunks are recycled. There are two buffers.

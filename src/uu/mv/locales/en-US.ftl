mv-about = Move SOURCE to DEST, or multiple SOURCE(s) to DIRECTORY.
mv-usage = mv [OPTION]... [-T] SOURCE DEST
  mv [OPTION]... SOURCE... DIRECTORY
  mv [OPTION]... -t DIRECTORY SOURCE...
mv-after-help = When specifying more than one of -i, -f, -n, only the final one will take effect.

  Do not move a non-directory that has an existing destination with the same or newer modification timestamp;
  instead, silently skip the file without failing. If the move is across file system boundaries, the comparison is
  to the source timestamp truncated to the resolutions of the destination file system and of the system calls used
  to update timestamps; this avoids duplicate work if several mv -u commands are executed with the same source
  and destination. This option is ignored if the -n or --no-clobber option is also specified. which gives more control
  over which existing files in the destination are replaced, and its value can be one of the following:

  - all This is the default operation when an --update option is not specified, and results in all existing files in the destination being replaced.
  - none This is similar to the --no-clobber option, in that no files in the destination are replaced, but also skipping a file does not induce a failure.
  - older This is the default operation when --update is specified, and results in files being replaced if theyâ€™re older than the corresponding source file.

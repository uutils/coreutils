cksum-about = Print CRC and size for each file
cksum-usage = cksum [OPTIONS] [FILE]...
cksum-after-help = DIGEST determines the digest algorithm and default output format:

  - sysv: (equivalent to sum -s)
  - bsd: (equivalent to sum -r)
  - crc: (equivalent to cksum)
  - crc32b: (only available through cksum)
  - md5: (equivalent to md5sum)
  - sha1: (equivalent to sha1sum)
  - sha224: (equivalent to sha224sum)
  - sha256: (equivalent to sha256sum)
  - sha384: (equivalent to sha384sum)
  - sha512: (equivalent to sha512sum)
  - blake2b: (equivalent to b2sum)
  - sm3: (only available through cksum)

# Help messages
cksum-help-algorithm = select the digest type to use. See DIGEST below
cksum-help-untagged = create a reversed style checksum, without digest type
cksum-help-tag = create a BSD style checksum, undo --untagged (default)
cksum-help-length = digest length in bits; must not exceed the max for the blake2 algorithm and must be a multiple of 8
cksum-help-raw = emit a raw binary digest, not hexadecimal
cksum-help-strict = exit non-zero for improperly formatted checksum lines
cksum-help-check = read hashsums from the FILEs and check them
cksum-help-base64 = emit a base64 digest, not hexadecimal
cksum-help-warn = warn about improperly formatted checksum lines
cksum-help-status = don't output anything, status code shows success
cksum-help-quiet = don't print OK for each successfully verified file
cksum-help-ignore-missing = don't fail or report status for missing files
cksum-help-zero = end each output line with NUL, not newline, and disable file name escaping

# Error messages
cksum-error-is-directory = { $file }: Is a directory
cksum-error-failed-to-read-input = failed to read input

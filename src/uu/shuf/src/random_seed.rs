/// Reproducible seeded random number generation.
///
/// The behavior should stay the same between releases, so don't change it without
/// a very good reason.
///
/// # How it works
///
/// - Take a Unicode string as the seed.
///
/// - Encode this seed as UTF-8.
///
/// - Take the SHA3-256 hash of the encoded seed.
///
/// - Use that hash as the input for a [`rand_chacha`] ChaCha12 RNG.
///   (We don't touch the nonce, so that's probably zero.)
///
/// - Take 64-bit samples from the RNG.
///
/// - Use Lemire's method to generate uniformly distributed integers and:
///
///   - With --repeat, use these to pick elements from ranges.
///
///   - Without --repeat, use these to do left-to-right modern Fisher-Yates.
///
/// # Why it works like this
///
/// - Unicode string: Greatest common denominator between platforms. Windows doesn't
///   let you pass raw bytes as a CLI argument and that would be bad practice anyway.
///   A decimal or hex number would work but this is much more flexible without being
///   unmanageable.
///
///   (Footgun: if the user passes a filename we won't read from the file but the
///   command will run anyway.)
///
/// - UTF-8: That's what Rust likes and it's the least unreasonable Unicode encoding.
///
/// - SHA3-256: We want to make good use of the entire user input and SHA-3 is
///   state of the art. ChaCha12 takes a 256-bit seed.
///
/// - ChaCha12: [`rand`]'s default rng as of writing. Seems state of the art.
///
/// - 64-bit samples: We could often get away with 32-bit samples but let's keep things
///   simple and only use one width. (There doesn't seem to be much of a performance hit.)
///
/// - Lemire, Fisher-Yates: These are very easy to implement and maintain ourselves.
///   `rand` provides fancier implementations but only promises reproducibility within
///   patch releases: <https://rust-random.github.io/book/crate-reprod.html>
///
///   Strictly speaking even `ChaCha12` is subject to breakage. But since it's a very
///   specific algorithm I assume it's safe in practice.

# "feat_external_libstdbuf": use an external libstdbuf.so for stdbuf instead of embedding it into
# the stdbuf binary.
# There are 2 use-cases:
# 1. Installation of uutils-coreutils using cargo install (e.g. from crates.io
#    which supports only "cargo install" as installation method).  In this case,
#    installing libstdbuf.so is impossible, because "cargo install" installs
#    only binary programs (no cdylib), thus libstdbuf.so must be embedded into
#    stdbuf and written to /tmp at runtime.  This is a hack, and may not work
#    on some platforms, e.g. because the SELinux permissions may not allow
#    stdbuf to write to /tmp, /tmp may be read-only, libstdbuf.so may not work
#    at all without SELinux labels, etc.
#
# 2. Installation of uutils-coreutils using an external tool, e.g. dpkg/apt on
#    debian. In this case, libstdbuf.so should be installed separately to its
#    correct location and the environment variable LIBSTDBUF_DIR configures the
#    installation directory during the build. E.g. LIBSTDBUF_DIR="/usr/lib"

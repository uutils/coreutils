rm-about = Remove (unlink) the FILE(s)
rm-usage = rm [OPTION]... FILE...
rm-after-help = By default, rm does not remove directories. Use the --recursive (-r or -R)
  option to remove each listed directory, too, along with all of its contents

  To remove a file whose name starts with a '-', for example '-foo',
  use one of these commands:
  rm -- -foo

  rm ./-foo

  Note that if you use rm to remove a file, it might be possible to recover
  some of its contents, given sufficient expertise and/or time. For greater
  assurance that the contents are truly unrecoverable, consider using shred.

# Help text for options
rm-help-force = ignore nonexistent files and arguments, never prompt
rm-help-prompt-always = prompt before every removal
rm-help-prompt-once = prompt once before removing more than three files, or when removing recursively.
  Less intrusive than -i, while still giving some protection against most mistakes
rm-help-interactive = prompt according to WHEN: never, once (-I), or always (-i). Without WHEN,
  prompts always
rm-help-one-file-system = when removing a hierarchy recursively, skip any directory that is on a file
  system different from that of the corresponding command line argument (NOT
  IMPLEMENTED)
rm-help-no-preserve-root = do not treat '/' specially
rm-help-preserve-root = do not remove '/' (default)
rm-help-recursive = remove directories and their contents recursively
rm-help-dir = remove empty directories

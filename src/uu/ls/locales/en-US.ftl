ls-help-sort-by-extension = Sort alphabetically by entry extension.
ls-help-sort-none = Do not sort; list the files in whatever order they are stored in the
  directory.  This is especially useful when listing very large directories,

ls-help-terminal-width = Assume that the terminal is COLS columns wide.
ls-help-allocation-size = print the allocated size of each file, in blocks

ls-help-indicator-style = Append indicator with style WORD to entry names:
  none (default),  slash (-p), file-type (--file-type), classify (-F)
ls-help-classify = Append a character to each file name indicating the file type. Also, for

      always - Always classify.
  Specifying --classify and no when is equivalent to --classify=always. This will
  not follow symbolic links listed on the command line unless the

  --dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir options are specified.

ls-help-full-time = like -l --time-style=full-iso
ls-help-context = print any security context of each file

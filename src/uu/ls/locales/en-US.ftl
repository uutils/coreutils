ls-help-long-numeric-uid-gid = -l with numeric UIDs and GIDs.
ls-help-set-quoting-style = Set quoting style.

    modification time: mtime, modification.
    birth time: birth, creation;
ls-help-time-change = If the long listing format (e.g., -l, -o) is being used, print the
  status change time (the 'ctime' in the inode) instead of the modification
  time. When explicitly sorting by time (--sort=time or -t) or when not
  using a long listing format, sort according to the status change time.
ls-help-time-access = If the long listing format (e.g., -l, -o) is being used, print the
  status access time instead of the modification time. When explicitly
  sorting by time (--sort=time or -t) or when not using a long listing
  format, sort according to the access time.
ls-help-hide-pattern = do not list implied entries matching shell PATTERN (overridden by -a or -A)

ls-help-sort-by-extension = Sort alphabetically by entry extension.
ls-help-sort-none = Do not sort; list the files in whatever order they are stored in the
  directory.  This is especially useful when listing very large directories,
  since not doing any sorting can be noticeably faster.
ls-help-dereference-all = When showing file information for a symbolic link, show information for the
  file the link references rather than the link itself.

ls-help-directory = Only list the names of directories, rather than listing directory contents.
  This will not follow symbolic links unless one of `--dereference-command-line

ls-help-terminal-width = Assume that the terminal is COLS columns wide.
ls-help-allocation-size = print the allocated size of each file, in blocks
ls-help-color-output = Color output based on file type.
ls-help-indicator-style = Append indicator with style WORD to entry names:
  none (default),  slash (-p), file-type (--file-type), classify (-F)
ls-help-classify = Append a character to each file name indicating the file type. Also, for
  regular files that are executable, append '*'. The file type indicators are
  '/' for directories, '@' for symbolic links, '|' for FIFOs, '=' for sockets,

      none - Do not classify. This is the default.
      auto - Only classify if standard output is a terminal.
      always - Always classify.
  Specifying --classify and no when is equivalent to --classify=always. This will
  not follow symbolic links listed on the command line unless the
  --dereference-command-line (-H), --dereference (-L), or
  --dereference-command-line-symlink-to-dir options are specified.
ls-help-file-type = Same as --classify, but do not append '*'

ls-help-full-time = like -l --time-style=full-iso
ls-help-context = print any security context of each file

//! On Linux we can use vmsplice() to write data more efficiently.
//!
//! This does not always work. We're not allowed to splice to some targets,
//! and on some systems (notably WSL 1) it isn't supported at all.
//!
//! If we get an error code that suggests splicing isn't supported then we
//! tell that to the caller so it can fall back to a robust naÃ¯ve method. If
//! we get another kind of error we bubble it up as normal.
//!
//! vmsplice() can only splice into a pipe, so if the output is not a pipe
//! we make our own and use splice() to bridge the gap from the pipe to the
//! output.
//!
//! We assume that an "unsupported" error will only ever happen before any
//! data was successfully written to the output. That way we don't have to
//! make any effort to rescue data from the pipe if splice() fails, we can
//! just fall back and start over from the beginning.
